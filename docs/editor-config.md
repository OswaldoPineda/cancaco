### What is EditorConfig?
---
EditorConfig helps maintain consistent coding styles for multiple developers working on the same project across various editors and IDEs.

When opening a file, EditorConfig plugins look for a file named .editorconfig in the directory of the opened file and in every parent directory.
A search for .editorconfig files will stop if the root filepath is reached or an EditorConfig file with root=true is found.
